VAR _returned_orders =DISTINCTCOUNT(Returns[Order ID])
VAR _perc =
DIVIDE(
    _returned_orders,
    _total_orders)
RETURN
_perc

2. profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])

4. % Returned orders py = 
CALCULATE(
    [% Returned orders],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('date table'[Date])
)

5. profit py = 
CALCULATE(
    [profit],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('date table'[Date])
)

6. sales py = 
CALCULATE(
    [sales],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('date table'[Date])
)

7. vs PY - % returned orders = 
[% Returned orders] - [% Returned orders py]

8. vs PY - profit =

    [profit py]
